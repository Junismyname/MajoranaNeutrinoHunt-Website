## Introduction

Our Applied Data Science project in NPML (Neutrino Physics Data Science) leverages machine learning to analyze time-series waveform data from the Majorana Demonstrator, aiming to detect energies related to neutrinoless double-beta decay. We focus on extracting key features and developing ML/DL models to enhance the precision of neutrino detection. This research could provide insights into the matter-antimatter asymmetry and the unique mass properties of neutrinos, although background interference poses challenges in signal identification.

### What is a Neutrino?

Neutrinos are extremely tiny, sub atomic particles. They don't have an electric charge and they are very difficult to probe. Because their mass is very less, they don't have much gravitational force acting upon them. Neutrinos are naturally produced through interactions in the unverse such as radioactive decay or nuclear reactions.
